**certain condition is met. they help in manage repetitive tasks.**



**1. for loop : use**d when the number of iterations is known beforehead.

2.While  loop:**use**d when the number of iterations is noy known and depends on a condition.

3.Do-while loop:Similar to the while loop,but guatanees that the block of the code will be executed at least once before checking the condition.
